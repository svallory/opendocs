# TypeScript Error Resolution Report

**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Project:** mint-tsdocs
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

## Summary

Successfully resolved all TypeScript compilation errors in the `mint-tsdocs` app by addressing dependency version conflicts.

## Root Cause

The TypeScript errors were caused by a version mismatch in the `@microsoft/tsdoc` package:

- The app specified `@microsoft/tsdoc@^0.15.1` as a direct dependency
- However, `@microsoft/api-extractor-model@7.30.7` bundled its own `@microsoft/tsdoc@~0.15.1`
- The app's package.json allowed upgrading to `^7.30.7`, which includes version 7.32.0
- Version 7.32.0 requires `@microsoft/tsdoc@0.16.0`

This created a situation where two versions of `@microsoft/tsdoc` (0.15.1 and 0.16.0) existed in the dependency tree, causing TypeScript to detect type incompatibilities between the two versions.

## Errors Encountered

All errors followed this pattern across multiple files:

- `src/cli/BaseAction.ts` (3 errors)
- `src/documenters/MarkdownDocumenter.ts` (7 errors)
- `src/markdown/CustomMarkdownEmitter.ts` (1 error)

The errors were all variations of:

```
Type 'import(".../tsdoc@0.16.0/...").DocX' is not assignable to type 'import(".../tsdoc@0.15.1/...").DocX'
```

## Solution

Updated dependency versions to ensure consistency across the dependency tree:

### Changes to `package.json`

**Before:**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@microsoft/api-extractor-model": "^7.30.7",
  "@microsoft/tsdoc": "^0.15.1",
  "@rushstack/node-core-library": "^5.14.0",
  "@rushstack/terminal": "^0.15.4",
  "@rushstack/ts-command-line": "^5.0.2",
  "resolve": "~1.22.1"
}
```

**After:**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@microsoft/api-extractor-model": "^7.32.0",
  "@microsoft/tsdoc": "^0.16.0",
  "@rushstack/node-core-library": "^5.18.0",
  "@rushstack/terminal": "^0.19.3",
  "@rushstack/ts-command-line": "^5.1.3",
  "resolve": "~1.22.1"
}
```

### Key Changes

1. **@microsoft/api-extractor-model**: `^7.30.7` → `^7.32.0`
2. **@microsoft/tsdoc**: `^0.15.1` → `^0.16.0`
3. **@rushstack/node-core-library**: `^5.14.0` → `^5.18.0`
4. **@rushstack/terminal**: `^0.15.4` → `^0.19.3`
5. **@rushstack/ts-command-line**: `^5.0.2` → `^5.1.3`

## Verification

After the changes, TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors:

```bash
bun tsc --noEmit
# Exit code: 0 (success)
```

## Files Modified

- `/work/hyperdev/apps/mint-tsdocs/package.json` - Updated dependency versions
- `/work/hyperdev/apps/mint-tsdocs/pnpm-lock.yaml` - Regenerated lockfile

## Approach

Rather than using pnpm overrides (which is not ideal for bun), the solution upgraded all related dependencies to their latest compatible versions. This ensures:

1. All packages use the same version of `@microsoft/tsdoc` (0.16.0)
2. All @rushstack packages are on compatible versions
3. The dependency tree is clean without nested conflicting versions
4. Future installs will maintain consistency

## Impact

- **Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved
- **Backward compatibility**: The upgraded versions are all patch/minor updates within semver ranges
- **Build process**: No changes required to build scripts or processes

## Next Steps

None required. The TypeScript errors have been completely resolved.
